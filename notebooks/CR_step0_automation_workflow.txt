CR step 0 automation workflow
1. Get prompt of year(yyyy) and month(mm) form user
2. select count(1) 
from IMS_APPLI.SYNC_FACT_ALL_INFO    
where sale_date = to_date(&current period., 'yyyymm')
order by to_char(SALE_DATE,'yyyymm');
3. Create folder 'F:\Shared4SASUsers\IA_Hospital\SVNpro\Customized Report\MSD.Regional\RawData\yyyymm'
4. Copy all files except ‘product_molecule.csv’ from A path to B path:
    A: \\bejsfps02\Feng Mingzhu\hospital\MSD project\mmMyy
    B: F:\Shared4SASUsers\IA_Hospital\SVNpro\Customized Report\MSD.Regional\RawData\yyyymm
5. Rename ‘product_molecule_updated.csv’ to ‘product_molecule.csv’ in the B path
6. Open ‘pack.csv’ in the B path with Notepad, and replace “” to “ ”.

In python, I have two user input variable year (yyyy) and month (mm). Define functions and a main function to step Network Drive Connection:
1. Define a function to check whether PD drive and DC drive is connected, 
    1.1 if yes print 'PD, DC network already exist' and return to main
    1.2 if no give user a chance to decide whether to connect PD and DC network drive by asking 'Do you want to mannually connect PD, DC network? (Y/N)'
        1.2.1 if Y, print 'Exiting program...' and exist the program
        1.2.2 if N, continue (return to main)
    where DC drive is 'F:\Shared4SASUsers\IA_Hospital\SVNpro\Customized Report\MSD.Regional\RawData' and PD drive is '\\bejsfps02\Feng Mingzhu\hospital\MSD project'
2. Define a funtion to get all available letter for network drive connection. Try to use os.
    2.1 print the first 2 letters of all available letters and use them to connect PD DC network drive respectively
3. Define a function to connect network drive
    3.1 print 'PD network drive is connected and the specific path' if PD drive is connected
    3.2 print 'DC network drive is connected and the specific path' if DC drive is connected
